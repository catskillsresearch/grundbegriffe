Alex J. Best: The last part requires a bit more proof, like mario says though, A1 and A2 giving the measurable sets of a measurable space doesn't really require the base type to be fin 3

  is_measurable_empty := by {rw A1, finish},
  is_measurable_compl := assume a h, by {rw A1 at *, finish},
  is_measurable_Union := assume f hf, by {rw A1 at *, simp,sorry },
Alex J. Best: The A2 version is easier

How do I get the size of an element of A1 or A2? Or even X? When I look at the definition of fin N, it is not clear that N is retained:


I want to be able to define a metric on A1 which is just the size of the finite set. This is not correct but I'm trying to get here:

def SubSet (X: Type) := set X ‚Üí Prop

def size (X: Type) (F: SubSet X) := sorry

-- docs#measure_theory.measure.count in mathlib

-- the proof that fin n has size n is docs#fintype.card_fin

-- if the set is finite you can use finset.card to get the cardinality

-- you can also use cardinal.mk to get the cardinality of an infinite set but for measures you really just want this to cap out at infinity so the infinite sum on ennreal is the easiest thing to implement

-- the proof that fin n has size n is docs#fintype.card_fin

def finite_set_measure_of(X: Type): SubSet X ‚Üí ennreal := Œª F, size X F

-- you have to prove that finite cardinalities are countably additive
