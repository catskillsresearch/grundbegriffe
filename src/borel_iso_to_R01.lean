/- A measurable function is a function between the underlying sets of two measurable spaces that preserves 
the structure of the spaces: the preimage of any measurable set is measurable.
In probability theory, a measurable function on a probability space is known as a random variable.

/- For a pairing between X and Y (where Y need not be different from X) to be a bijection, four properties must hold:
each element of X must be paired with at least one element of Y,
no element of X may be paired with more than one element of Y,
each element of Y must be paired with at least one element of X, and
no element of Y may be paired with more than one element of X.
